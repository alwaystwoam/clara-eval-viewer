      "explanation": "KAFD Conference Center is selected as the primary venue to honor the host’s requirement to stage the summit within KAFD and to align the experience with Vision 2030’s future-forward narrative. It meets core functional needs (600-seat auditorium and four concurrent track rooms via multipurpose hall partitions), supports VIP/ministerial protocols with secured perimeter management, and provides strong branding moments across KAFD’s iconic architecture with metro adjacency for sustainable access. While the indicative rental is higher and airport transfers are slightly longer than peers, these trade-offs are justified by the strategic KAFD location, security posture, and district-level sustainability and digital credentials. RFECC is the leading contingency for maximum scalability (rooms/exhibit and parking) and fast RUH transfers. Hilton Riyadh offers a refined, budget-efficient hotel-conference alternative meeting the 4-track requirement with comfortable plenary headroom.\n\nAvailability diligence: Targeted searches as of 2026-01-11 found no conflicting public events at KAFD, RFECC, or Hilton on Oct 15–17, 2026. KAICC references (FII, UNIDO GC21) are maintained in evidence for context only.",

Estimates are inclusive of typical vendor fees and 15% KSA VAT where applicable; exchange planning uses the SAR peg at ~3.75 SAR per USD. Key benchmarks used: Riyadh day‑delegate catering commonly SAR 250–400 pp/day; large hall daily rentals often SAR 80k–150k; chauffeur S‑Class and 50‑seater coach rates aligned to Riyadh providers; interpreter booths/headsets and pro teams budgeted for main stage with expansion option. Assumes partnership offsets on venue hire due to strategic alignment with KAFD/partners. High range targets the full US$750k budget ceiling; low range reflects efficiencies and in‑kind support. Recommend locking venue/AV/catering early and maintaining the contingency at 10–12% through show week.",

Speaker ops: brief all main-stage speakers and government participants to dress Business Formal (suit/tie or national formal), especially for opening, ministerial keynotes, and press photos. Print a short cultural note: “Modest, Riyadh-appropriate business attire; national dress welcome.” Avoid on-site enforcement friction—provide guidance in pre-arrival emails and the website FAQ. Place a small supply of emergency layers (neutral shawls/blazers), lint rollers, and shoe-shine near green rooms. Confirm that abaya/headscarf are not required at KAFD and that prayer room access is signed. Reception style mirrors daytime (no costume change).",
    "description": "Polished business wear for a high-level, international conference. Think blazers, dresses, or suits; ties are optional. Choose modest cuts (covered shoulders; hemlines at or below the knee; no sheer/low-cut pieces). National and cultural dress is warmly welcomed (e.g., thobe/bisht, abaya; headscarf optional for international guests). Speakers and photo moments: consider elevating to business formal (suit and tie or equivalent). Evening reception follows the same Business Smart tone—no outfit change required, but you may add a jacket or statement accessory. Indoors are cool with strong AC; outdoors can feel hot and very dry in October, so breathable fabrics and light layers work best.",

      "men": "Business Smart: suit or blazer with dress shirt or smart knit; tie optional. Trousers or chino-style pants; polished dress shoes or sleek loafers.

Please avoid shorts, athleisure, casual tees, distressed denim, beachwear, or overly flashy logos."

    "internalRecommendations": "Default to Business Smart for all three days. Add a line in speaker confirmations: “Stage dress: Business Formal or national formal.” Include a short FAQ item clarifying modest norms, footwear, and headscarf optionality for international guests. Pre-brief photography teams to be culturally sensitive. Remind production to manage stage temperature (strong AC) and provide anti-slip stage surfaces to accommodate traditional footwear. Include a discrete note for international VIPs: a bisht/abaya is not required but may be worn for ceremonial photos at their discretion."

Friday (Oct 16) programming should include a Jumu’ah buffer around midday.

For the evening reception, outdoor conditions are favorable; optional fans are adequate—misters generally unnecessary in very dry air.",

Mitigations: hydration/shade; sunscreen distribution; monitor Saudi NCM and WMO SDS‑WAS advisories 72–24 hours out; prepare an indoor fallback for the reception if an atypical dust event materializes; share AC comfort note with guests to bring light layers."
